PROBLEM:

1) Fruits Cart to add fruits to cart and calculate cart value
CASE 1: calculate for N number of Fruits
CASE 2: Calculate price for seasonSales for every fruit

SOLUTION: 

1) Defined 2 models
    i) Fruit [States name and price of a fruit]
   ii) BuyAndGet [States the minimum buy count and respective free count of a fruit]
   
2) Defined Cart Services with addToCart and totalCartValue implementations
    i) addToCart [Gets parameters as Fruit(Fruit),Count(int) and SeasonSale(boolean)]
        case 1: if seasonSale is true 
             Redefine Count with buyAndGet Count [ count=((count/totalCountAfterBuyFree)*minimumBuyCount)+(count%totalCountAfterBuyFree)]
             and add the fruits to FruitsList
        case 2: if seasonSale is false
             Add fruits to FruitsList

  ii) totalCartValue [Returns TotalCart Price]
      Get each fruit count,price and return their multiplies value
